## PasswordGenerator

## Description

- Generates random passwords involving special characters and numbers that users can generate and save for future use. Also allows them to adjust the length of the password as well.

- I generated this random generator to help users come up with unique passwords that would be hard to hack.
  I created the password generator using functions and string values using the variable let and prompts to alert the user of the type of password they want created.
  My motivation behind this project to become comfortable with javascript and functions.
