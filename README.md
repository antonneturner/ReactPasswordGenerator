# PasswordGenerator

Description.
Generates random passwords involving special characters and numbers that users can generated and save for future use. Also allows them to adjust the length of the password as well.
I generated this random generator to help users come up with unique passwords that would be hard to hack.
I created the password generator using functions and string values using the variable let and prompts to alert the user of the type of password they want created.
My motivation behind this project to become comfortable with javascript and functions. I will continue praticing, studying and learning until i master or feel comfortable with javascript and its functionality.
I learned about functions and how they work but more importantly i learned that i have much more to learn and need to improve my understanding and skills to implement a more confident experience for myself.
My project stands out more on the css side and also has checkboxes inside of the generator.
